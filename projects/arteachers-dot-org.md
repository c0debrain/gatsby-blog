[ARteachers.org](https://arteachers.org/) is a react+redux web app that allows teachers in Arkansas to find great jobs, and helps school districts find great teachers as well. I built this project in my spare time over the course of about a year and a half, and it is now live!  

It leverages Firebase and Cloud Firestore on the backend to provide an easy-to-use system that gives job-seekers the tools to find what is right for them, and to apply for it right within the app. School districts end up with a powerful tool to vet applicants, ensuring they find the perfect person for every position.
